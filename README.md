# tour-application
Developed an application that uses IP raw sockets to "walk" through(send packets to) a list nodes which are local to each other running on Virtual Machines, similar to the Internet Protocol Strict Source and Record Routing option. At each node, the application pings the previous node from which it got the packet by sending ICMP echo request messages and gets an echo reply using PF_PACKET sockets. All the nodes join a multicast group and exchange multicast messages when the "tour" is complete. ARP functionality is implemented to get the Ethernet addresses of the target nodes.
